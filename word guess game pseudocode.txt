Create a header and use the hangman image provided
	-html header w/css or use bootstrap	


Create an event using .onKeyUp (key-press) to initialize the game 
	-  "Press Any Key To Get Started" is displayed
		* OPTIONAL - change color of the text when any key is pressed and return it to normal when the first guess is taken
	-  After a key is pressed, turn off this text
		

						''''''JAVASCRIPT''''''
-  create an array that contains the available words (do 10)
	-  Show one of the array words with each letter hidden with an underscore shown (use a math.random function to pick between available words)
		
		*  if an incorrect letter is pressed leave the underscore for that space
			- show that letter under the "Letters Already Guessed" (in a row) 
			- add one to "Number of Guesses Remaining"
			- maximum guesses is 13.  If the number of incorrect guesses = 13, then the game is over and "Game Over" is displayed - GAME RESETS
		

		*  When the correct letter for that space is chosen, display that letter and remove the underscore
			- show that letter under the "Letters Guessed" (in a row) 
			- no affect on "Number of Guesses Remaining"
			- maximum guesses is 13.  If the number of incorrect guesses = 13, then the game is over and "Game Over" is displayed - GAME RESETS
			- When the total word is displayed, display You Win! - GAME RESETS

- keep track of the number of wins a user has (keep until the game is reset) 


*  Use a Math.Random function to pick the random word
